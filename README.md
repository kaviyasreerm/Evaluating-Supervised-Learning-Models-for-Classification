# A Comprehensive Analysis of Performance Metrics of Supervised Classification Learning Models

This project evaluates and compares the performance of Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and LSTM networks using multiple performance metrics. The project utilizes the Breast Cancer dataset and employs a 10-fold cross-validation approach to ensure a comprehensive and reliable evaluation. The study highlights the trade-offs between different metrics, with Random Forest and LSTM outperforming the other models in a holistic evaluation. 

#### Files:

- Code for classification algorithms and evaluation metrics computation are enclosed as source_code.py and source_code.ipynb 

- No specific dataset file is uploaded as data is obtained from built-in python library. 

- A detailed explanation of the entire project is illustrated in the file report.pdf
